# Day 1 — Python Fundamentals Refresh

## Goals
- Refresh basic Python syntax
- Practice data types and numerical operations
- Build discipline for daily logging

## Work Done
- Practiced variable swapping using tuple unpacking
- Worked with user input and explicit type casting
- Explored floating-point precision using `decimal.Decimal`
- Implemented time conversion from seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds

## Key Learnings
- Python supports clean variable swapping without temporary variables
- User input is always received as a string and requires casting
- Decimal precision control is important for numerical accuracy
- Integer division and modulo are useful for time-based calculations

## Blockers / Questions
- None
